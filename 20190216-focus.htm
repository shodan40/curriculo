Focus

For so many years I heard I were antisocial.

To be honest I do admit that I don't like to go to any party. I don't like to visit people who are not my friends.

When I was a child, my daddy used to get me grounded because it was rare for me to go out and have lunch with an uncle who came to visit us.

At that time I couldn't explain the reason I was so boring. At least I was a boring child from their point of view.

Today I look back and understand why I was that weird kid. 

The reason is... I only do what I love to do. And it is not trivial, it is not easy.
Many times, after days, weeks, months, years... most people quit doing what they must do.

"Why is this so hard for me?" - people think.

Today I started harvesting the fruits of the seeds. I'm not better than anyone and I won't let my ego think like that. 
I just learned the beauty of being focused.

When I was at 5th grade I asked my daddy: How much money you're going to pay me for each A (100) I get at school?

Getting an A is not just nail a test, it englobes class participation, homework and assiduity. My daddy thought it was an impossible mission so he says he would pay US$ 100 per grade A.

I got six As of eight disciplines, then he said:
"- Ok boy, don't push yourself that much otherwise I'm going to be poor"

Today I can say that we don't develop courage being happy every day. We develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity.
