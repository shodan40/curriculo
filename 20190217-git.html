Using Git

ssh ftpuser@ftp.domainname

Provide the password of your ftp user to stablish the connection.

Once you're connected to your hosting via ssh, the first step is to create SSH keys.
Access the .ssh directory:

cd ~/.ssh [Enter]

ls [Enter]

If you see the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub within this directory, you already have your keys. 
If you don't see these files or the directory .ssh does not exist, you must create it:

mkdir ~/.ssh [Enter]
cd ~/.ssh [Enter]

To create the key files, use the command:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@seudominio.com.br"

When asked about the file which you would like to save the key, you can just press [Enter] and the default name id_rsa.pub will be used.
When asked about the passphrase, you can let it empty for no passphrase. If this is the case, just press [Enter]

You'll see the key's randomart image.

To see the content of your key, use the command:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
